Wayback machine API
===================

Simple wayback interface for archive.org.

ðŸ“¦ Installation & Basic Usage
-----------------------------

To install the package call Composer and execute the following command:

```shell
$ composer require baraja-core/wayback
```

No configuration is needed, the package will take care of the dependencies itself. The use of DIC is not required. The cache is automatically stored on the filesystem.

How to use
----------

Simply create instance of Wayback and call methods:

```php
$wayback = new Wayback;

// Return list of available archives by host
$wayback->getArchivedUrlsByHost('baraja.cz');

// Return list of available archives by URL (http/https and www will be ignored)
$wayback->getArchivedUrls('https://php.baraja.cz/navody');

// Return list of crawled subdomains (for large sites can not be complete)
$wayback->getSubdomains('baraja.cz');

// Save now given URL to Wayback
$wayback->saveUrl('https://baraja.cz');

// Find nearest archived datetime
$wayback->getClosedArchivedDateTime('https://baraja.cz/robots.txt', new \DateTime('2020-09-04'));

// Find and download nearest archived file
$wayback->getClosedArchivedFile('https://baraja.cz/robots.txt', new \DateTime('2020-09-04'));

// Download specific file by wayback link
$wayback->getArchivedFile('http://web.archive.org/web/20200923184117/https://baraja.cz/robots.txt');
```

The return of all results from the Wayback Machine is subject to caching. The results are automatically cached on your file system.

DateTime
--------

DateTime is stored in Wayback format (string). Wayback stores the date in the UTC timezone. This package converts datetime automatically.

Example: Date `20050101143010` is `2005-01-01 14:30:10`.
