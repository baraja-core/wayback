Simply create instance of Wayback and call methods:

```php
$wayback = new Wayback;

// Return list of available archives by host
$wayback->getArchivedUrlsByHost('baraja.cz');

// Return list of available archives by URL (http/https and www will be ignored)
$wayback->getArchivedUrls('https://php.baraja.cz/navody');

// Return list of crawled subdomains (for large sites can not be complete)
$wayback->getSubdomains('baraja.cz');

// Save now given URL to Wayback
$wayback->saveUrl('https://baraja.cz');
